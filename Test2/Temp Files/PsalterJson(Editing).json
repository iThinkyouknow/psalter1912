Instructing our sons we gladly record\nThe praises, the works, the might of the Lord,\nFor He hath commanded that what He hath done\nBe passed in tradition from father to son.\n\n3. Let children thus learn from history's light\nTo hope in our God and walk in His sight,\nThe God of their fathers to fear and obey,\nAnd ne'er, like their fathers, to turn from His way.\n\n4. The story be told, to warn and restrain,\nOf hearts that were hard, rebellious, and vain,\nOf soldiers who faltered when battle was near,\nWho kept not God's covenant nor walked in His fear.\n\n5. God's wonderful works to them He had shown,\nHis marvelous deeds their fathers had known;\nHe made for their pathway the waters divide,\nHis glorious pillar of cloud was their guide.\n\n6. He gave them to drink, relieving their thirst,\nAnd forth from the rock caused water to burst;\nYet faithless they tempted their God, and they said,\nCan He Who gave water supply us with bread?\n\n7. Jehovah was wroth because they forgot\nTo hope in their God, and trusted Him not;\nYet gracious, He opened the doors of the sky\nAnd rained down the manna in richest supply.\n\n8. With bread from on high their need He supplied,\nAnd more did He do when thankless they sighed;\nThe strong winds commanding from south and from east,\nHe sent them abundance of quail for their feast.\n\n9. Though well they were filled, their folly they chose,\nTill God in His wrath o'erwhelmed them with woes;\nHe slew of their strongest and smote their young men,\nBut still unbelieving they sinned even then.\n\n10. Because of their sin He smote with His rod,\nAnd then they returned and sought for their God;\nTheir Rock and Redeemer was God the Most High,\nYet false were their praises, their promise a lie.\n\n11. Not right with their God in heart and in will,\nThey faithlessly broke His covenant still;\nBut He, in compassion, reluctant to slay,\nForgave them and oft turned His anger away.\n\n12. His pity was great, though often they sinned,\nFor they were but flesh, a swift passing wind;\nYet though His compassion and grace they beheld,\nThey tempted and grieved Him and often rebelled.\n\n13. They limited God, the Most Holy One,\nAnd hindered the work His grace had begun;\nThe hand that was mighty to save they forgot,\nThe day of redemption remembering not.\n\n14. Ungrateful and blind, no longer they thought\nOf wonders and signs and mighty deeds wrought,\nOf how all the rivers of Egypt ran red,\nAnd plagues in God's anger were heaped on their head.\n\n15. They thought not of how, their freedom to gain,\nIn Egypt's abodes the first-born were slain,\nAnd how all God's people were led forth like sheep,\nThe flock He delighted in safety to keep.",
